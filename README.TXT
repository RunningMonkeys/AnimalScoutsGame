Game design, we wanted to offer the player key signs to know hows turn it is.
Highlighted tiles show the player their only move chooses for each character.
Audio feed back to acknowledge your turn is complete. For the music an kids 
game was selected that was easy to listen to for the duration of the game. 
Issues with networking makes this game playable with one computer. Back ground
charaters set on different loop help keep the player distracted while waiting
for the next player to move keeping the emersive feel. 



Mecanim:  Pikachu, a bunny and a chicken were selected because they
		  were the only FBX files the correctly loaded into Maximo. 
		  The player cannot not move correctly and had to remain 
		  stationary. 

Pikachu(s) - both are set to dance then idle loop. with 2 - 3 different dances 
			 between them.

Bunny(s) - first experiment they both cheer and wave each offset both in a loop. 

Chicken(s) - Each one has is setup with different gestures, idles, dances 
			 and waves. 

Cheerleader(s) - they are programmed to dance in 3 - 4 different dances with out 
				 any idle. that feature would not work with them.
